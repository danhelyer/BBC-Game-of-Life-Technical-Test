# Dan Helyer: BBC Graduate Trainee Scheme Technical Test
I completed this Technical Test — to design Conway's Game of Life — using **Python 3.7**.
It can be run from the Command Line.

## Assumptions
In completing this task I made the following assumptions:
2. An infinite grid is not possible, instead users may define grid dimensions
3. Rather than beginning with a predefined seeded grid, random grid generations are acceptable
